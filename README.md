Various Python projects that I developed while learning the language

## reddit_ticker.py

Uses PRAW library to scrap reddit data.

Uses ktinker to generate a frame and run the ticker in the frame.
You can resize, move the window. the code allows you to change the font size, color and background to suit your taste.
You will need to create an account with reddit and then create an API to get your client ID/secret.

Next step would be to use it on a TV streaming box like Amazon Fire tve and use it as a personalized ticker on the screen.


## reddit_cli.py

This is a very simple proof of concept that runs the code on Windows command window. I ended up using it more than ktinker version.
The way I use it is by resizing the window and color to align on top of my screen and then set it to 'Always on top'.
This code doesn't do a 'ticker' but rather displays each post heading for 10 secs before refreshing.
